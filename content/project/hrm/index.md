We developed an web application to enable Operations of [AFD](https://www.afd.fr/en) to visualize and drive insights from population density, conflicts and crisis data, facilities locations and other demographic data.
This work was based on the open-source tool [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/), a layer of Mapbox developed by Uber.
The different datasets used are available on [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)
